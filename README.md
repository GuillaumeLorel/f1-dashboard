# F1 Dashboard üèéÔ∏è

Welcome to the GitHub repository for **F1 Dashboard**, a dynamic web application designed for Formula 1 enthusiasts. This project is the result of my passion for F1 and represents my first foray into web application development. **F1 Dashboard** allows users to follow their favorite teams and drivers, access up-to-date statistics, and much more.

## About the Project üöÄ

**F1 Dashboard** is developed using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a popular React framework for building modern websites and web applications. I chose Next.js for its ease of use, performance, and native support for Server Side Rendering (SSR), significantly improving SEO and user experience.

To design an elegant and responsive user interface, I utilized [Shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn/ui), a rich and modern UI component library. This allowed me to create a consistent and attractive user experience while saving development time.

The data is powered by [Ergast API](http://ergast.com/mrd/), a comprehensive and free API for Formula 1 data. This API provides access to a wealth of historical and current information on races, teams, and drivers, enabling **F1 Dashboard** to present accurate and up-to-date data.

## Main Features ‚ú®

- **Dynamic Dashboard**: Track the real-time performance of your favorite drivers and teams.
- **Detailed Statistics**: Dive into comprehensive statistics on past and current races.
- **Dark/Light mode**: Enjoy a dark and ligth mode build with TailwindCSS.

## Coming Soon üöß

As **F1 Dashboard** continues to evolve, here are some exciting features to look forward to:

- **Responsive Design Overhaul**: I'am working to make every aspect of the app fully responsive, ensuring a seamless and engaging user experience on any device.
- **About Page**: Get to know more about me, my socials medias etc.
- **Advanced Data Graphs**: To bring the data to life, I plan to implement advanced graphing features, allowing users to visualize statistics through interactive and informative charts.
